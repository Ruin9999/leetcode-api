# Leetcode API

An unofficial API for interfacing with [leetcode's](https://leetcode.com) graphql database.

## Why ü§î

While working on other projects, I realized that there weren't many easy options for interacting
with the leetcode's grapql api. So when I needed data, I had to reverse engineer the API to get what I needed.

This project was built to solve that problem.

Built with [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/).
## Lessons Learnt üìñ

- How to build a Backend/API with [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/).
